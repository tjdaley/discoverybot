RELEVANT,Objection is made to the production request to the extent the proposed discovery is not relevant to the subject matter of the suit and will not lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(a). The proposed discovery goes beyond the subject matter of the case and reasonable expectations of obtaining information that will aid resolution of the dispute. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192 cmt. 1.
CREATE,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent the request would require the responding party to create a document not in existence. A party is not required to produce a document or tangible thing unless it is within the person's possession, custody, or control. A document that does not exist is not within a party's ""possession, custody, or control."" The only exception to the rule involves the factual observations, tests, or supporting data of a testifying expert. In re Colonial Pipeline Co., 968 S.W.2d 938, 942 (Tex. 1998); see also Tex. R. Civ. P 192.3(b)."
CONSULTING,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent that it seeks the identity, mental impressions, opinions, and/or documents or tangible things containing such information of consulting experts either informally consulted or specially retained in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial that were not reviewed by a testifying expert witness. Tex. R. Civ P. 192.3(e)."
CUMULATIVE,Objection is made to the production request to the extent that the discovery sought is unreasonable cumulative or duplicative. Tex R. Civ. P. 192.4(a).
OTHER_SOURCE,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent the discovery sought is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. Tex R. Civ P. 192.4(a)."
BURDEN,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.4(b)."
UNDUE,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent it subjects the responding party to undue burden, unnecessary expense, harassment, or annoyance. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.6(b)."
INVASION,"Objection is made to the production request to the extent it subjects the responding party to an invasion of personal, constitutional, or property rights. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.6(b)."
OVERLY_BROAD,"Objection is made to the production request because it is overly broad and is not in compliance with rule 196.1(b), which requires the request to specify the items to be produced or inspected, either by individual item or category, and describe with reasonable particularity each item and category. See also Tex. R. Civ P. 193 cmt. 2."
LATE,Objection is made to the production request because it was served on the responding party later than thirty days before the end of the discovery period. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.1(a).
SPECIFY_FORM,Objection is made to the request for production of data or information that exists in electronic or magnetic form because [opposing party] failed to specify the form in which [opposing party] wants it produced. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.4.
CANNOT_RETRIEVE,Objection is made to the request for production of data or information that exists in electronic or magnetic form because the responding party cannot - through reasonable efforts - retrieve the data or information requested. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.4.
CANNOT_PRODUCE,Objection is made to the request for production of data or information that exists in electronic or magnetic form because the responding party cannot - through reasonable efforts - produce the data requested in the form requested. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.4.
EARLY,Objection is made to the production request because it was served on the responding party less than thirty days after the due date for required disclosures. Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.2(a).
PROPORTIONAL,"Objection is made to the request because it is not proportional to the needs of the case. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.4(b); In re State Farm Lloyds, 520 S.W.3d 595, 607 (Tex. 2017).  Specifically,  the  request  is  not  proportional  because  the  likely  benefits  of  the  requested  discovery  are  minimal,  and  therefore  any  enhanced  effort  or  expense  in  producing  the  information  is  undue,  the  requested  discovery  is  not  justified considering the needs of the case, and the requested discovery is of low importance  to  resolving  the  issues  in  the  case.  See  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  192.4(b);  In  re  State Farm, 520 S.W.3d at 608."
